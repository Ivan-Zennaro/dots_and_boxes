Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players. It was first published in the 19th century by French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, dot to dot grid, boxes, and pigs in a pen.

## Rules

  1. Choose the players' identity and color, and the grid size;
  2. At each Player's turn, a line from the game grid must be selected;
  3. The player who completes a box gets a point and has an extra turn;
  4. Two players compete to complete most boxes in the game grid\sand to get more points!
  5. You can also choose to host or join a server-based game on the main menu.
                        
  ### Enjoy the game!

## Cli version
You can insert which game mode you want to start from the main menu.

The following is the representation of the board in the Command Line version.

To insert a line there are 3 parameters [*x*, *y*, *side*]:
- *x*,*y* are the coordinates of one of the two adjacent boxes composed by that line
- *side* = [U, D, L, R] is the position of the line with respect to that box: Up, Down, Left, Right.
